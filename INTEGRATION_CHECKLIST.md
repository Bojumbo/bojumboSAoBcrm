# ✅ Frontend-Backend Integration Checklist

## 🎯 Pre-Integration Setup

### Backend Requirements
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is running
- [ ] Backend `.env` file is configured with database credentials
- [ ] Prisma client is generated (`npx prisma generate`)
- [ ] Database schema is applied (`npx prisma db push`)
- [ ] Initial data is seeded (`npm run db:seed`)
- [ ] Backend server starts without errors (`npm start`)

### Frontend Requirements
- [ ] `.env` file is created with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001`
- [ ] All dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation is successful

## 🔧 Integration Steps

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Server is running on port 3001
🔗 Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
🔗 API endpoints: http://localhost:3001/api/*
```

### 2. Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-XX...",
  "message": "Backend server is running successfully!"
}
```

### 3. Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in XXX ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### 4. Test Frontend-Backend Connection
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check Console for any CORS or connection errors
4. Navigate to login page

## 🧪 Integration Testing

### Authentication Test
- [ ] Login form loads without errors
- [ ] Can login with test credentials:
  - Admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
  - Head: `ivan.p@example.com` / `head123`
  - Manager: `maria.i@example.com` / `manager123`
- [ ] JWT token is stored in localStorage
- [ ] User is redirected after successful login
- [ ] Protected routes are accessible when authenticated

### API Endpoint Tests
- [ ] **GET /api/auth/me** - Returns current user data
- [ ] **GET /api/projects** - Returns projects list with pagination
- [ ] **GET /api/sales** - Returns sales list with relationships
- [ ] **GET /api/products** - Returns products list
- [ ] **GET /api/counterparties** - Returns counterparties list

### File Upload Test
- [ ] File upload component renders correctly
- [ ] Can select and upload files
- [ ] Files are stored in backend `uploads/` directory
- [ ] File URLs are returned and can be accessed

### Role-Based Access Test
- [ ] Admin can access all data
- [ ] Head can access own + subordinate data
- [ ] Manager can access only own data
- [ ] Unauthorized access is blocked

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Errors
**Symptoms:** Browser console shows CORS policy errors
**Solution:** Ensure backend CORS is configured for frontend URL

### Authentication Failures
**Symptoms:** Login returns 401/403 errors
**Solution:** Check JWT secret and database connection

### File Upload Failures
**Symptoms:** Files fail to upload or return 500 errors
**Solution:** Verify upload directory permissions and disk space

### Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms:** Backend fails to start or API calls fail
**Solution:** Check PostgreSQL status and connection string

## 📊 Performance Verification
